# Answer-Evaluation-System
This project automates grading of handwritten descriptive exam answers using OCR, Machine Learning, and NLP. Scanned answers are converted to digital text, then compared to instructor-provided keywords using cosine similarity to generate scores, significantly reducing educators’ manual workload for subjective evaluations.
